# convmem — Local knowledge corpus

You have access to a local knowledge corpus via convmem. Use it before repeating past work.


1. **`convmem doctor`** — run first. Must exit 0 before any ask/search. Confirms Ollama/Chroma health.
2. **`convmem brief --stdout-only`** — session orientation: corpus state, recent decisions, monitor results, unresolved count. When also calling MCP **`brief()`**, pass **project=<slug>** inferred from cwd (see Tier B).
3. **`convmem unresolved`** — check open observations. Add `--site <hostname>` for client-specific issues (e.g. `--site staging2.willowyhollow.com`). For multiple sites, prefer **separate** `convmem unresolved --site …` calls (or one call without `--site`). Avoid `echo` separators unless comparing output side-by-side.
4. **Before answering history/architecture questions:** use `convmem "search query"` or `convmem ask "question"` to ground responses in the ledger.

**Cursor with shell:** run `convmem doctor` before MCP `brief()` — doctor confirms infra; brief does not.

**Codex-specific:** if `convmem ask` fails with a network error (sandbox blocks localhost), retry with:
```
bash -lc 'convmem ask "your question here"'
```
The `-l` flag sources `~/.zshrc`/`~/.bashrc` where Ollama's PATH is set. For permanent access in the convmem repo: `cp .codex/config.toml.example .codex/config.toml` to enable `network_access = true`.


## Read-only guard

Do not run `convmem add`, `convmem index`, or `convmem verify` without user direction.
