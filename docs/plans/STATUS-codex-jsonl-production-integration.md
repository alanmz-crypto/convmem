## 1. What This Is For (product goal)

ConvMem currently reprocesses an entire Kiro session transcript whenever its
append-heavy `messages.jsonl` changes. Arc Codex aims to make repeated indexing
incremental and crash-replayable: reuse stable historical chunks, transform
only the overlap frontier and new messages, and never pay twice for a completed
transform after a crash.

**Done means:** disabled-by-default production code has passed hermetic
real-Chroma fault/replay review, a one-shot exact-resource production canary
has measured frontier reuse and the cross-collection visibility/recovery seam,
and a separately authorized activation can later enable one controlled Kiro
source without changing chunking, retrieval, or other adapters. Production
activation is not part of the current phase.

## 2. System Design (how the pieces connect)

```text
Kiro sess_*/messages.jsonl (read-only source authority)
                   |
                   v
          normal adapter detection
                   |

                   |
                   v
      IncrementalJsonlCoordinator
        | source prefix snapshot + continuity
        | overlap-aware chunk frontier
        | fsynced prepared transform cache
        | checkpoint + transaction + rollback journal
        v
       existing governed writer/pruner
          |                     |
          v                     v

          \_____________________/
                    |
          checkpoint commits first
                    |
          export/dedupe/processed followers
```

Key invariants:

- source JSONL is source authority; checkpoint is processing/recovery
  authority; Chroma and sidecars are derived projections;
- absent/false feature configuration is the current path unchanged;
- only `jsonl_kiro_session` is eligible;
- a selected complete prefix may be followed by a pure append, but cannot be
  replaced, truncated, or mutated before commit;
- expensive outputs are fsynced before any Chroma write;
- both real Chroma collections converge or restore from exact before-images;
- `processed.json` cannot advance before checkpoint authority; and
- all implementation verification is temporary, local, network-denied, and
  provider-free.

## 3. What Exists Right Now (file map)

| Surface | Current state |
|---|---|
| Incremental coordinator | On `main`. Routing remains exact-source opt-in; an existing indexed source without a valid checkpoint refuses rather than silently rebuilding. |
| Hermetic isolation | Tokenized, fake-provider test boundary; it cannot be used as a live switch. |
| Format registry | Kiro session JSONL and admitted Codex rollouts have governed production routes. Cursor JSONL and Crush SQLite remain outside this route. |
| Recovery parity | PR #396 (`9ef4ecd`) generalized checkpointless-recovery and lineage-mismatch protection to every production-boundary source while preserving Codex-only admission policy. |
| Deploy compatibility | PR #399 (`9be0a4f`) separated semantic transform compatibility from implementation provenance so compatible deploys retain paid work. |
| Commit cost | PR #404 (`07117ed`) removed the redundant full Chroma scan from incremental commits. |
| Kiro exact-source route | PR #406 (`adcf5b3`) added opt-in Kiro v2 routing, semantic session identity, source-scoped paid-call accounting, and a crash-safe cohort budget. It is merged but no Kiro source is selected in the current live configuration. |
| Live configuration | Read-only check on 2026-10-19 found `[index.incremental_jsonl].enabled = true` and `live_sources = []`. The watcher is enabled and active for other configured work; this pause does not alter it. |
| Prior bootstrap authority | Every earlier proposal, digest, backup binding, and execution grant is historical or stale. None may be reused after the code and live-state changes above. |

## 4. Completion State

| Milestone | State | Next gate |
|---|---|---|
| Coordinator and canary | Merged on `main` through PR #301 | Preserve reviewed behavior |
| Guarded production boundary | Merged through PR #365 (`f3171fc`), exact-source opt-in | No source enrollment without a fresh Ryan grant |
| Paid accounting and supersession | Merged through PR #381 (`e798bba`) | Preserve carried-attempt and stale-authority refusal rules |
| Kiro recovery parity | Merged through PR #396 (`9ef4ecd`) after Kiro and Copilot PASS | Complete |
| Transform compatibility | Merged through PR #399 (`9be0a4f`) | Complete; migration remains separately governed |
| Incremental commit cost | Merged through PR #404 (`07117ed`) | Complete |
| Kiro v2 exact-source implementation | Merged through PR #406 (`adcf5b3`) with exact identity and hard paid-call budget | Implementation complete; live proof remains |
| Live Kiro proof and activation | **PAUSED by Ryan on 2026-10-19**; no selected Kiro source | Explicit resume decision, then fresh evidence and authority |

## 5. Your Role

Arc Codex is intentionally **on hold**. Preserve the merged implementation and
do not prepare or execute another bootstrap, provider call, source enrollment,
config/runtime promotion, migration, or watcher change. Do not regenerate an
old proposal in place and do not reuse any prior exact grant, backup binding,
source digest, or budget.

When Ryan explicitly resumes the arc, begin from current `origin/main` and
current live state. Re-measure every mutable identity and produce fresh review
artifacts before requesting authority. The implementation work is complete;
the remaining work is a live proof and later activation decision.

## 6. What Remains Before Live (sequential)

1. Wait for Ryan to explicitly resume Arc Codex. No preparation work is active
   while the hold remains.
2. On resume, re-read this brief and verify current `origin/main`, deployed
   runtime, live config, watcher state, exact source prefix and sidecar identity,
   embedding dimension, provider binding, paid-attempt ledger, and mutation
   inventory.
3. Create fresh complete-data local and offsite backup evidence under a new,
   separately reviewed backup authority. Historical backup IDs are readiness
   evidence only and cannot authorize a new run.
4. Prepare one new exact-source proposal and review packet. Kiro reviews route
   and bootstrap assumptions; Copilot audits safety and isolation on the same
   revision.
5. Ryan decides a new exact one-shot grant. If granted, execute only its named
   source, runtime, config, dimension, and paid-call budget and return measured
   call, coverage, lineage, recovery, and isolation evidence.
6. Any continuing enrollment, runtime/config promotion, migration, or watcher
   change remains a later, separate Ryan decision.

## 7. Hard Stops

| Stop | Owner | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture/plan review | Kiro | Cursor implementation before independent design review |
| Execute grant | Ryan | Any production-code implementation |
| Default-off flag | Live config + Ryan | Incremental routing in production |
| Bootstrap required | Separate Ryan grant | Adoption/rebuild of existing indexed sources and associated model cost |
| Implementation evidence review | Kiro | PR disposition and any production canary |
| Production canary | Ryan | Live source/Chroma/config/provider operation |
| Activation | Ryan | Feature enablement and watcher participation |

No model may infer one gate from another. In particular, plan PASS, code merge,
or canary PASS does not enable production indexing.

## 8. Relationship to ConvMem

Arc Codex changes the ingestion efficiency and recovery mechanism for one
adapter. It does not change ConvMem's source/projection authority direction,
retrieval scoring, semantic calibration, or other active arcs.

- The source transcript remains authoritative input.
- Chroma remains the serving projection used by current retrieval.
- The production writer gate, source locks, exclusion/purge rules, Shadow
  mutation observation, and R2b writer inventories remain in force.
- Recovery Authority and CG-2 govern different production authority changes;
  Arc Codex cannot invoke their operations.
- The drifting live golden retrieval baseline is unrelated to this planning
  diff and is not run or retuned here.

The known cross-collection atomicity seam is not declared solved: Chroma has no
atomic two-collection transaction. The before-image journal makes a torn apply
recoverable, while a later canary must measure how long mixed state can remain
visible to readers.

## 10. How to Update This Brief

Keep this document a current-state snapshot, not a session diary.

1. Overwrite sections 3–6 after a milestone moves; do not append narrative.
2. Change branch-only state to `main` only after verifying the merge.
3. Rewrite section 5 for the next lane.
4. Remove completed work from the forward sequence.
5. Add one milestone-level Update Log row.
6. Preserve hard stops until Ryan explicitly crosses them.
7. Test: a fresh model should know the current authority and next action from
   this file alone.

| 2026-10-05 | Codex | Opened PR #365; corrected the Pylint regression without changing the safety contract, obtained Copilot/Kiro PASS at 05197a7, and kept the watcher disabled while remaining CI waits for runners |
| 2026-10-05 | Codex | Resolved the full-suite reload-order failure, brought PR #365 current with main, and obtained Copilot/Kiro exact-tip PASS plus six green checks at b17f47c; Ryan's merge and live grants remain separate |
| 2026-10-09 | Ryan | Squash-merged guarded Kiro live-route implementation via PR #365 as f3171fc; production bootstrap, activation, watcher restart, and broader source coverage remain ungranted |
| 2026-10-09 | Sol | Resolved the exact-source packet conflict in Copilot's favor and obtained same-revision Kiro/Copilot PASS at corrected commit 4aecb96; packet remains `NO-GO` pending Ryan's implementation-correction decision |
| 2026-10-09 | Ryan / Sol | Ryan authorized Cursor's bounded hermetic bootstrap-safety corrective; live resources, providers, PR creation, merge, and watcher/config/runtime operations remain gated |
| 2026-10-09 | Cursor / Sol | Implemented the authorized bootstrap-safety corrective at 273c27a on a collision-safe post-PR-#369 branch; focused tests and Pylint pass, while exact-tip review and CI-equivalent full-suite evidence remain |
| 2026-10-09 | Sol-High | Accepted Copilot's exact-revision FAIL over Kiro's PASS: APPLYING replay can replace original rollback/isolation authority; carried work onto post-PR-#370 main for Cursor correction |
| 2026-10-09 | Cursor / Sol | Corrected replay authority, independent dimension preflight, and redirects at b108ab6; focused, inventory, secret, invariant, and Pylint gates pass; exact-tip review and CI-equivalent full suite remain |
| 2026-10-09 | Kiro / Copilot | Both lanes issued complete PASS verdicts with no blockers on exact corrected revision 318c2f9; CI-equivalent full suite and Ryan's PR decision remain |
| 2026-10-10 | Cursor | Live bootstrap exposed paid-cap mis-accounting (Ollama embeds counted against DeepSeek `max_provider_http_attempts`); runtime fix `32fae68`, 12 focused passes at evidence commit `2b7228b`, Copilot scoped PASS on runtime, Kiro PASS on evidence; next gate Ryan PR/merge decision |
| 2026-10-10 | Cursor / Sol | Failed-operation supersession implementation complete on `fix/2026-10-10-kiro-bootstrap-failed-operation-supersession` (manifest-bound carried accounting, 34 focused pytest cases, pylint clean); exact-tip Kiro/Copilot review next; no live retry/config/watcher authority |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol / Kiro / Copilot | Exact-tip review complete at `a6169a5`: both lanes PASS after contained exclusive lineage-temp creation closed the final blocker; 178 affected production-Python tests pass; Ryan PR/merge decision next |
| 2026-10-10 | Ryan / Sol | Ryan merged PR #381 as `e798bba`; source remains unchanged and fresh successor packet preparation began with live execution still `NO-GO` |
| 2026-10-10 | Kiro / Copilot | Both lanes PASS the exact successor packet at `c7c12e8`, digest `b7dc9bfc…b980`; Ryan's backup-disposition and execution-grant decisions remain |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Mounted the designated offsite drive and verified snapshot `653a8198…f7ac4` as the exact Restic copy of local snapshot `ac1087c8…a3954`; refreshed packet awaits same-revision Kiro/Copilot review |
| 2026-10-10 | Kiro / Copilot | Both lanes PASS packet `f9418bf`, digest `f8ca5df1…ceb3d`, with no blockers; Ryan's separate exact-grant decision is next, with Restic recheck and writer-window advisories to include |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Authorized successor grant safely refused before activation or calls: packet used pre-overlay fingerprint `7fda8eef…f8528`; corrected post-overlay fingerprint is `d2ecd101…473f5`; exact corrected-packet review is next |
| 2026-10-10 | Kiro / Copilot | Both lanes PASS corrected packet `b380a43`, digest `3b9d1138…b21ff`, with no blockers; Ryan's new exact-grant decision is next, with fresh backup and named writer-isolation conditions |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Created fresh local snapshot `19201163…340a5` and exact offsite copy `bfa9ac35…16da1`, sharing tree `eb4cd065…575a`; refreshed packet awaits narrow same-revision review |
| 2026-10-10 | Kiro / Copilot / Sol | Both lanes PASS refreshed packet `2fa81eb`, digest `5e29ae13…90bb`, with no blockers; Sol prepared non-executed replacement proposal operation `c5fec18c…79c81`; Ryan's exact-grant decision is next |
| 2026-10-10 | Ryan / Sol | Ryan authorized replacement proposal `c5fec18c…79c81`; exact local Restic resolution timed out before writer pause or transport, so execution stopped with zero new calls or corpus mutation and the proposal remains unconsumed |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Diagnosed the local Restic timeout as a workspace-sandbox boundary: the same exact-ID read completed with the expected tree in 0.728 seconds under scoped host access; the proposal remains unconsumed pending Ryan's retry decision |
| 2026-10-10 | Ryan / Sol | Ryan authorized the retry; local exact validation succeeded under scoped host access, but offsite snapshot `bfa9ac35…16da1` timed out after 120 seconds, so execution again stopped before transport or mutation and the proposal remains unconsumed |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Diagnosed the offsite timeout as Restic's normal lock path against the read-only mount; explicit `--no-lock` opened the repository and returned the exact expected snapshot/tree in about 0.55 seconds without mutation |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Corrected the temporary validator to use `--no-lock` only offsite; the exact local/offsite IDs, shared tree, copy lineage, paths, timestamp, and tags all PASSed, with the proposal still unconsumed |
| 2026-10-10 | Ryan / Sol | Ryan authorized another exact retry; after backup PASS and writer-window establishment, supersession admission refused the stale proposal on predecessor mutation-inventory mismatch before grant materialization, dimension probing, transport, or mutation |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Proved the sole drift was a 310-byte append to live `synthesis_failures.jsonl`: two mocked HTTP-failure rows from `tests/test_index_loud_failures.py`; all other mutation surfaces, including Kiro Chroma rows, remained exact |
| 2026-10-10 | Cursor / Copilot / Sol | Cursor isolated the mocked failure logger to temporary test storage at `eaae6e9`; Copilot's targeted safety/isolation audit PASSed that exact code commit with no blockers; tests and linters remain unrun pending Ryan's decision |
| 2026-10-10 | Sol | Focused pytest passed both provider-refusal cases in 0.50 seconds while the live failure ledger's SHA-256, size, and nanosecond mtime remained identical; all paused timers were restored active and Ryan's PR decision is next |
| 2026-10-10 | Claude | Recorded PR #381 merge (`e798bba`); drafted Codex rollout admission design for Kiro review on `docs/2026-10-10-issue-286-codex-rollout-admission-design`; no live authority |
| 2026-10-10 | Kiro | Design PASS at `9e91973` with six binding conditions (design §13); next gate Ryan implementation grant |
| 2026-10-10 | Ryan / Claude | Ryan granted hermetic Cursor implementation; Execute handoff written; resume state `NOT_STARTED` |
| 2026-10-11 | Kiro / Claude | Kiro amended design §13 conditions 3–4: refusal quarantine is terminal by path (digest is evidence only); implementation on `feat/2026-10-10-issue-286-codex-rollout-admission` needs one more corrective |
| 2026-10-11 | Kiro / Copilot / Claude | Gate 3 FAIL at `905ad40` (Kiro: Pylint gate; Copilot: six safety findings); Kiro accepted the D8 lineage fields and generic quarantine; corrective-4 handoff written, `NOT_STARTED` |
| 2026-10-11 | Kiro / Copilot / Claude | At `a5f1756`, Kiro PASS and Copilot FAIL (D8 refusal quarantine, checkpointless recovery, `~` root); Claude confirmed all three |
| 2026-10-11 | Cursor | Corrective 5 (C5b, C1b, C6b, D1) applied; Copilot and Kiro recheck of the new tip next |
| 2026-10-11 | Copilot / Kiro / Claude | Copilot PASS and Kiro PASS at `78b9295`; PR #388 opened; next gate Ryan Stage 1 grant |
| 2026-10-17 | Cursor | Implemented the Stage 2 prerequisite failure-cache and repository-knowledge inventory refresh on `fix/2026-10-17-repository-manifest-failure-cache`. Live config and watcher remain untouched. |
| 2026-10-19 | Ryan / Sol | Paused Arc Codex after PRs #396, #399, #404, and #406 merged; implementation is preserved on `main`, no Kiro source is selected, and resume requires fresh state and authority. |

## TL;DR

- Recovery, compatibility, commit-cost, and Kiro v2 route work is merged through
  PR #406 (`adcf5b3`).
- Arc Codex is paused before live Kiro proof or activation. Current config has
  no selected Kiro source; the active watcher was not changed.
- Resume requires Ryan's explicit decision and entirely fresh source, runtime,
  config, backup, budget, review, and execution authority.
