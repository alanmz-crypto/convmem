## 1. What This Is For (product goal)

ConvMem currently reprocesses an entire Kiro session transcript whenever its
append-heavy `messages.jsonl` changes. Arc Codex aims to make repeated indexing
incremental and crash-replayable: reuse stable historical chunks, transform
only the overlap frontier and new messages, and never pay twice for a completed
transform after a crash.

**Done means:** disabled-by-default production code has passed hermetic
real-Chroma fault/replay review; a separately authorized activation can later
enable one controlled Kiro source without changing chunking, retrieval, or
other adapters. Production activation is not part of the current phase.

## 2. System Design (how the pieces connect)

          checkpoint commits first
                    |
          export/dedupe/processed followers
```

Key invariants:

- source JSONL is source authority; checkpoint is processing/recovery
  authority; Chroma and sidecars are derived projections;
- absent/false feature configuration is the current path unchanged;
- only `jsonl_kiro_session` is eligible;
- a selected complete prefix may be followed by a pure append, but cannot be
  replaced, truncated, or mutated before commit;
- expensive outputs are fsynced before any Chroma write;
- both real Chroma collections converge or restore from exact before-images;
- `processed.json` cannot advance before checkpoint authority; and
- all implementation verification is temporary, local, network-denied, and
  provider-free.

## 3. What Exists Right Now (file map)

| Surface | Current state |
|---|---|
| `incremental_jsonl.py` | New production coordinator on `feat/2026-09-10-codex-jsonl-production-integration`; the implementation is default-off and now includes the PR #293 pylint-regression correction. Live enable without `CONVMEM_INCREMENTAL_ROOT` fail-closed skips rather than writing. |
| `ingest.py` | Build/commit split; default-off dispatch after detect; content-addressed UUID4 ingest assertion IDs |
| `adapters/kiro_session_jsonl.py` | `parse()` unchanged; `parse_complete_prefix()` adds byte ranges |
| `config.py` / `config.example.toml` | `[index.incremental_jsonl]` absent/false by default |
| `chroma_store.py` | Source-scoped snapshot/restore primitives |
| `watch.py` | Unchanged; still `convmem index --file` |
| `incremental_jsonl_isolation.py` | Hermetic T0 boundary; `-I` workers get host site via `CONVMEM_INCREMENTAL_SITE` |
| `docs/plans/VERIFY-codex-jsonl-production-integration.md` | Cursor T0–T6 evidence |
| `docs/plans/ARCHITECTURE-codex-jsonl-production-integration.md` | Kiro-reviewed production architecture; PASS at `84ec51a` |
| `docs/plans/EXECUTION-codex-jsonl-production-integration.md` | Ryan-authorized bounded Cursor T0–T6 plan |
| Scratch prototype + canary on `main` | Unchanged inherited evidence |

PR #293 is open for the disabled implementation. No live config, production
Chroma, watcher, provider, bootstrap, canary, or activation exists.

## 4. Completion State

| Milestone | Status | Blocking on |
|---|---|---|
| Scratch JSONL state machine | **DONE on `main`** (PR #289) | — |
| Isolated real-Chroma writer/pruner pass | **DONE on `main`** (PR #291) | — |
| Read-only live-source canary | **DONE on `main`** (PR #292) | — |
| Production architecture | **PASS at `84ec51a`** | — |
| Bounded Execute plan | **PASS / AUTHORIZED** | — |
| Ryan architecture/Execute acceptance | **DONE 2026-09-10** | — |
| Cursor implementation | **DONE on feature branch** (`5341bb1` plus scoped PR #293 lint correction) | Exact-tip correction recheck |
| Implementation review/PR | **PR #293 OPEN**; Kiro PASS at `162d67f`; local corrected gates PASS | CI green at corrected tip, then Kiro re-binds review before Ryan merge decision |
| Production bootstrap/canary | **UNAUTHORIZED** | Separate post-merge Ryan grant |
| Watcher/feature activation | **UNAUTHORIZED** | Separate evidence and Ryan decision |

## 5. Your Role

**If Ryan sent you to review now:** you are Kiro. After PR #293 CI is green,
fetch `feat/2026-09-10-codex-jsonl-production-integration` and recheck the
scoped pylint-regression correction after `162d67f`. Confirm that it removes
only lint debt, preserves the reviewed safety semantics, and keeps the writer
inventories revision-bound. Do not enable the flag or touch live state.

**If Ryan sent you to implement:** Cursor T0–T6 is already pushed. Do not
re-execute unless Kiro returns a concrete contradiction.

**If Ryan sent you to activate:** stop unless the exact source, live config
change, provider/cost boundary, watcher state, rollback action, and canary stop
condition are separately authorized. Merge of disabled code is not activation.

## 6. What Remains Before Live (sequential)

1. PR #293 CI passes at the corrected feature tip.
2. Kiro rechecks the correction delta and binds PASS to that exact tip.
3. Ryan decides whether to squash-merge the disabled implementation PR.
4. After merge, Ryan separately chooses a new source or authorizes a one-time
   clean bootstrap rebuild and its model-cost ceiling.
5. A bounded production-path canary measures cross-collection mixed visibility,
   replay time, frontier calls, and rollback under an exact source/grant.
6. Independent review decides whether watcher/feature activation is safe.
7. Ryan alone edits live configuration or activates the watcher route.

## 7. Hard Stops

| Stop | Owner | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture/plan review | Kiro | Cursor implementation before independent design review |
| Execute grant | Ryan | Any production-code implementation |
| Default-off flag | Live config + Ryan | Incremental routing in production |
| Bootstrap required | Separate Ryan grant | Adoption/rebuild of existing indexed sources and associated model cost |
| Implementation evidence review | Kiro | PR disposition and any production canary |
| Production canary | Ryan | Live source/Chroma/config/provider operation |
| Activation | Ryan | Feature enablement and watcher participation |

No model may infer one gate from another. In particular, plan PASS, code merge,
or canary PASS does not enable production indexing.

## 8. Relationship to ConvMem

Arc Codex changes the ingestion efficiency and recovery mechanism for one
adapter. It does not change ConvMem's source/projection authority direction,
retrieval scoring, semantic calibration, or other active arcs.

- The source transcript remains authoritative input.
- Chroma remains the serving projection used by current retrieval.
- The production writer gate, source locks, exclusion/purge rules, Shadow
  mutation observation, and R2b writer inventories remain in force.
- Recovery Authority and CG-2 govern different production authority changes;
  Arc Codex cannot invoke their operations.
- The drifting live golden retrieval baseline is unrelated to this planning
  diff and is not run or retuned here.

The known cross-collection atomicity seam is not declared solved: Chroma has no
atomic two-collection transaction. The before-image journal makes a torn apply
recoverable, while a later canary must measure how long mixed state can remain
visible to readers.

## 10. How to Update This Brief

Keep this document a current-state snapshot, not a session diary.

1. Overwrite sections 3–6 after a milestone moves; do not append narrative.
2. Change branch-only state to `main` only after verifying the merge.
3. Rewrite section 5 for the next lane.
4. Remove completed work from the forward sequence.
5. Add one milestone-level Update Log row.
6. Preserve hard stops until Ryan explicitly crosses them.
7. Test: a fresh model should know the current authority and next action from
   this file alone.

### Update Log

| Date | Who | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-09 | Codex | Created Arc Codex production-integration architecture, bounded Execute plan, and Kiro review boundary after merged scratch/canary evidence |
| 2026-09-09 | Codex | Applied Kiro C1–C3 precision review: accurate processed-state sidecar/source-lock interval, named source-before-export invariant, and explicit new incremental prune trigger |
| 2026-09-10 | Codex | Finalized C1 to preserve the standalone processed-state critical section after releasing the source-locked apply; C2/C3 remain confirmed |
| 2026-09-10 | Codex | Recorded Kiro PASS at `84ec51a` and Ryan's bounded Cursor T0–T6 Execute grant; implementation remains not started and operational actions remain gated |
| 2026-09-10 | Cursor | Landed hermetic T0–T6 on `feat/2026-09-10-codex-jsonl-production-integration` at `5341bb1`; next lane is exact-tip Kiro review. No PR, live indexing, or activation |
| 2026-09-10 | Codex | Opened PR #293 after Kiro PASS at `162d67f`; corrected the CI pylint-regression delta without changing the baseline, and routed the new exact tip back to Kiro before merge |

## TL;DR

- Arc Codex production code is implemented, disabled by default, and open as
  PR #293 with a scoped pylint-regression correction after Kiro's `162d67f`
  PASS.
- CI must pass at the corrected tip, then Kiro must recheck that exact delta
  before Ryan's merge decision.
- Live indexing, providers, migration, PR creation, bootstrap/canary, and
  activation remain separately Ryan-gated.
