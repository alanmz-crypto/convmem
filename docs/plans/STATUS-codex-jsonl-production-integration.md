## 1. What This Is For (product goal)

ConvMem currently reprocesses an entire Kiro session transcript whenever its
append-heavy `messages.jsonl` changes. Arc Codex aims to make repeated indexing
incremental and crash-replayable: reuse stable historical chunks, transform
only the overlap frontier and new messages, and never pay twice for a completed
transform after a crash.

**Done means:** disabled-by-default production code has passed hermetic
real-Chroma fault/replay review, a one-shot exact-resource production canary
has measured frontier reuse and the cross-collection visibility/recovery seam,
and a separately authorized activation can later enable one controlled Kiro
source without changing chunking, retrieval, or other adapters. Production
activation is not part of the current phase.

## 2. System Design (how the pieces connect)

```text
Kiro sess_*/messages.jsonl (read-only source authority)
                   |
                   v
          normal adapter detection
                   |
       flag off/non-Kiro ─────────> legacy whole-file ingest
                   |
                   v
      IncrementalJsonlCoordinator
        | source prefix snapshot + continuity
        | overlap-aware chunk frontier
        | fsynced prepared transform cache
        | checkpoint + transaction + rollback journal
        v
       existing governed writer/pruner
          |                     |
          v                     v
 conversation_summaries   knowledge_units
          \_____________________/
                    |
          checkpoint commits first
                    |
          export/dedupe/processed followers
```

Key invariants:

- source JSONL is source authority; checkpoint is processing/recovery
  authority; Chroma and sidecars are derived projections;
- absent/false feature configuration is the current path unchanged;
- only `jsonl_kiro_session` is eligible;
- a selected complete prefix may be followed by a pure append, but cannot be
  replaced, truncated, or mutated before commit;
- expensive outputs are fsynced before any Chroma write;
- both real Chroma collections converge or restore from exact before-images;
- `processed.json` cannot advance before checkpoint authority; and
- all implementation verification is temporary, local, network-denied, and
  provider-free.

## 3. What Exists Right Now (file map)

| Surface | Current state |
|---|---|
| Incremental coordinator | On main, default off. Enabled Kiro routing without the hermetic root returns skipped. Existing indexed sources without a checkpoint return bootstrap_required/skipped. |
| Hermetic isolation | Tokenized, fake-provider test boundary; it cannot be a live switch. |
| Format registry | Kiro JSONL outside isolation; Codex history/rollout only inside isolation. Cursor JSONL and Crush SQLite are not eligible. |
| Canary runtime | P2 readiness correction merged by PR #301 (8983a6f); no live P2 or activation grant. |
| Issue #286 successor | S0-S3 branch 19d34a5 remains unmerged; exact-tip Copilot docs acceptance and Kiro rechecks are needed. |
| Issue #286 live design | Fresh branch from origin/main ff5ce7b; see DESIGN-issue-286-live-activation.md. No engine change yet. |
| Watcher | Stopped and disabled 2026-10-05 at Ryan's request; runtime pin a92a74e unchanged. |

## 4. Completion State

| Milestone | State | Next gate |
|---|---|---|
| Coordinator and canary | Merged on main through PR #301; disabled | Preserve reviewed behavior |
| S0-S3 Codex route | Reviewed 506afc1, successor 19d34a5 unmerged | Copilot/Kiro exact-tip recheck and Ryan PR decision |
| Live-activation design | Draft on fresh branch | Copilot safety audit and Kiro design review |
| Production boundary and exact-source gate | Not implemented | Design review, hermetic implementation and tests |
| Existing-source bootstrap | Not implemented or live-authorized | One-source proof, tests, review, Ryan budget/resource grant |
| Watcher activation | Unauthorized; watcher disabled | Separate Ryan promotion/config/restart grant |

## 5. Your Role

Codex is preparing issue #286 branch work under Ryan's 2026-10-05 proceed
instruction. Copilot audits isolation and the earlier documentation-acceptance
failure; Kiro reviews the same exact revision. Ryan alone merges and grants
one-source bootstrap or any runtime promotion and watcher restart. Branch work
and review do not authorize live-corpus access.

## 6. What Remains Before Live (sequential)

1. Review the design and reconcile the S0-S3 successor against current main.
2. Implement a distinct production boundary and exact-source route without
   loosening the hermetic contract; prove default-off, unrelated-source,
   crash, rollback, and fail-closed behavior with temporary resources.
3. Prove a one-shot existing-source bootstrap or retain the legacy route;
   account for its one-time provider cost.
4. Obtain fresh exact-tip Copilot and Kiro PASS verdicts and Ryan's PR decision.
5. Obtain separate Ryan grants for any exact-source bootstrap and later
   runtime/config/restart test. Measure calls and coverage by source class.

## 7. Hard Stops

| Stop | Owner | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture/plan review | Kiro | Cursor implementation before independent design review |
| Execute grant | Ryan | Any production-code implementation |
| Default-off flag | Live config + Ryan | Incremental routing in production |
| Bootstrap required | Separate Ryan grant | Adoption/rebuild of existing indexed sources and associated model cost |
| Implementation evidence review | Kiro | PR disposition and any production canary |
| Production canary | Ryan | Live source/Chroma/config/provider operation |
| Activation | Ryan | Feature enablement and watcher participation |

No model may infer one gate from another. In particular, plan PASS, code merge,
or canary PASS does not enable production indexing.

## 8. Relationship to ConvMem

Arc Codex changes the ingestion efficiency and recovery mechanism for one
adapter. It does not change ConvMem's source/projection authority direction,
retrieval scoring, semantic calibration, or other active arcs.

- The source transcript remains authoritative input.
- Chroma remains the serving projection used by current retrieval.
- The production writer gate, source locks, exclusion/purge rules, Shadow
  mutation observation, and R2b writer inventories remain in force.
- Recovery Authority and CG-2 govern different production authority changes;
  Arc Codex cannot invoke their operations.
- The drifting live golden retrieval baseline is unrelated to this planning
  diff and is not run or retuned here.

The known cross-collection atomicity seam is not declared solved: Chroma has no
atomic two-collection transaction. The before-image journal makes a torn apply
recoverable, while a later canary must measure how long mixed state can remain
visible to readers.

## 10. How to Update This Brief

Keep this document a current-state snapshot, not a session diary.

1. Overwrite sections 3–6 after a milestone moves; do not append narrative.
2. Change branch-only state to `main` only after verifying the merge.
3. Rewrite section 5 for the next lane.
4. Remove completed work from the forward sequence.
5. Add one milestone-level Update Log row.
6. Preserve hard stops until Ryan explicitly crosses them.
7. Test: a fresh model should know the current authority and next action from
   this file alone.

| 2026-09-12 | Cursor | CI overlay-digest and writer-inventory corrective after repo-wide pytest failure on preserved `6cb0107`; next lane is Kiro exact-tip recheck of the new tip. Existing PR #301. No Claude, live Gate 0/P2, or replacement grant |

| 2026-10-05 | Codex | Reconciled merged canary state and opened issue #286 live-activation design; watcher disabled at Ryan's request |

## TL;DR

- Arc Codex's coordinator and canary are on main, default off.
- Ryan stopped and disabled the watcher on 2026-10-05 for cost containment.
- Issue #286 activation needs a distinct production boundary, existing-source
  bootstrap decision, and fresh exact-tip review before any live grant.
