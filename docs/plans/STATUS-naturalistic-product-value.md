**Arc:** Naturalistic ConvMem product-value evaluation

**Current state:** G1–G4 are landed on `main` through squash-merged PR #255 at
`787a6ef8077f099820b8ab903777dd67951c9bb7`. Kiro's independent PASS is bound to
the exact G4 implementation SHA `fa7d68b4b272a9802b0983c708800d6953ec45f8`.
This is a pre-live methodology substrate only; no product disposition or study
execution authority follows from the merge.

## 1. What This Is For (product goal)

This arc asks whether ConvMem creates measurable product value during ordinary
work: compared with the same fresh agent without ConvMem, does ConvMem improve
meaningful recovery and continuation when evaluated prospectively, symmetrically,
and with sealed evidence?

**Done means:** a later, separately authorized prospective study can produce an
auditable co-primary report and an allowed product disposition. A methodology
merge, dry-run, or partial result is not a product conclusion.

The landed G1–G4 package supplies contracts, fixtures, adjudication and probe
scaffolds, bounded episode scoring, co-primary aggregation, sparse/scorer
reliability states, and information-gate parameter slots. It does not collect
episodes, run agents, select live thresholds, or access the ConvMem corpus.

Key invariants:

- every episode remains in the opportunity denominator;
- target count cannot weight an episode more than once in paired analysis;
- malformed, duplicate, orphaned, sparse, and non-evaluable inputs fail closed;
- target-present-but-not-evaluable is opportunity-only, never invented effect;
- scorer and gate slots are explicit pre-live records, not hidden defaults;
- G4 can never emit a positive, negative, null, or equivalent product conclusion.

## 3. What Exists Right Now (file map)

| Surface | State |
|---|---|
| `docs/plans/ARCHITECTURE-naturalistic-product-value.md` | Locked planning package; non-authorizing design document |
| `docs/plans/EXECUTION-naturalistic-product-value.md` | Serial gate plan; non-authorizing execution document |
| `eval_naturalistic/contracts.py`, `base.py`, `enums.py`, `digest.py` | G1 contract and identity substrate on `main` |
| `eval_naturalistic/adjudication.py` and fixtures | G2 target census/adjudication scaffold on `main` |
| `eval_naturalistic/probe_construction.py` and fixtures | G3 probe/key construction scaffold on `main` |
| `eval_naturalistic/analysis.py` and fixtures | G4 bounded analysis/statistical machinery on `main`; reviewed bytes unchanged at `fa7d68b` |
| `tests/test_naturalistic_{contracts,adjudication,probe,analysis}.py` | Focused G1–G4 coverage; PR #255 CI passed |
| PR #255 | Squash-merged to `main` as `787a6ef8…`; GitHub pytest, Pylint, and CodeQL checks passed |
| Live runner, study controller, Agent A/B campaign, and corpus access | Not part of G1–G4; absent or unauthorized |

## 4. Completion State

| Gate | State | Evidence / next authority |
|---|---|---|
| G1 architecture/contracts | **DONE on `main`** | PR #255; architecture remains non-authorizing |
| G2 adjudication machinery | **DONE on `main`** | PR #255; no natural episode census has run |
| G3 probe construction machinery | **DONE on `main`** | PR #255; no live key or study sample exists |
| G4 analysis/statistical machinery | **DONE on `main`** | Kiro PASS at exact `fa7d68b`; focused 98 tests + 8 subtests; Pylint 10/10 |
| G5 dry-run/fixture verification | **NOT STARTED** | Requires Ryan's separate explicit grant; synthetic only |
| G6 prospective study freeze and later T7–T11 gates | **NOT AUTHORIZED** | Requires G5 evidence, then distinct Ryan grants |
| Product disposition | **UNAVAILABLE** | T10 is the only later stage permitted to produce one |

## 5. Your Role (read this to know what you're here to do)

If Ryan sent you for status or delivery, verify `main@787a6ef8`, this brief, and
the linked handoff; do not reopen implementation or infer a G5 grant.

If Ryan explicitly grants G5, the next implementation lane is Cursor for the
bounded synthetic dry-run, followed by the required independent review. Keep
fixtures synthetic and preserve the G4 ceiling. Ryan owns every transition into
G5, G6, live execution, and product interpretation.

If you do not know why you are here, ask Ryan. The default next decision is a
bounded G5 grant, not a live study.

## 6. What Remains Before "Live"

- [x] Land G1–G4 methodology package on `main` (PR #255).
- [x] Record exact-SHA Kiro PASS and focused verification.
- [x] Reconcile canonical routing and add this arc brief.
- [ ] Ryan explicitly grants G5 synthetic dry-run/fixture verification.
- [ ] Cursor implements only the granted G5 dry-run; retain synthetic-only data.
- [ ] Independent review accepts the exact G5 artifact and evidence.
- [ ] Ryan separately authorizes G6 prospective freeze and later T7–T11 gates.
- [ ] Only a fully authorized T10 path may produce a product disposition.

## 7. Hard Stops (models cannot cross)

| Stop | Owner / invariant | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| G4 ceiling | Analysis contract; T10-only disposition rule | Any product conclusion from G1–G4 code or fixtures |
| G5 grant | Ryan | Dry-run execution before explicit authorization |
| G6 and later grants | Ryan | Prospective frame, agents, episodes, scoring, and live ConvMem |
| Pre-live numerical slots | Ryan after the required review | Choosing meaningful-advantage, equivalence, precision, sparsity, or scorer thresholds |
| Corpus/live boundary | Arc execution plan | Corpus access, mutation, or ordinary-work campaign from this lane |

## 8. Relationship to ConvMem (the bigger picture)

This is an evaluation arc, not a serving-path change. It consumes sealed
evaluation artifacts and eventually reports product evidence alongside ConvMem's
retrieval, synthesis, and provenance surfaces. It does not replace JudgeBench,
R2b capture authorization, Shadow activation, or Recovery Authority; each remains
separately governed.

## 10. How to Update This Brief (departure protocol)

Keep this document a current-state snapshot, not a session diary. When a gate
changes state, overwrite sections 3–6, remove completed future work from section
6, and add one milestone-level line below. Do not add chat narrative here; ingest
the session transcript separately under Track A.

### Update Log

- 2026-08-30 — Codex: recorded PR #255 squash merge of G1–G4 on `main`, exact-SHA Kiro PASS, and the separate Ryan-owned G5 boundary.

**TL;DR:** G1–G4 are landed and reviewed, but this arc remains pre-live; Ryan's
next decision is an explicit synthetic G5 grant, and no product conclusion is
available from the merged methodology.
