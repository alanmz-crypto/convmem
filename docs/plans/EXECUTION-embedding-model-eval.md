# EXECUTION — Embedding-Model A/B Evaluation (two-gate operator runbook)

**Status:** Gate 1 harness **merged** at immutable SHA `3b2790f50414f0445c35748e52f849c6276839f7` (PR #44 squash). Hermetic R2a authorization implementation is in PR #52 (awaiting exact-tip GitHub Copilot audit-lane + Kiro PASS). Merge of #52 does **not** authorize R2a execution, eval-root writes, R2b+, or Gate 2.
**Authority:** Architecture Rev 1 (binding) + Gate 1 / Gate 2 human gates + R2a–R8 experimental checkpoints.
**R2a schema amendment:** [`docs/inter-model/CURSOR-2026-07-19-r2a-auth-schema-amendment.md`](../inter-model/CURSOR-2026-07-19-r2a-auth-schema-amendment.md) — hermetic impl tracked in #52; no external R2a writes authorized.

## Two-gate model

| Gate | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Gate 1** | Approves the completed evaluator (tracked code, hermetic tests, fixtures). **Done** — pin `3b2790f`. No live capture/builds/evals under Gate 1. |
| **Gate 2** | Reviews the first real comparison’s evidence (external approval sidecar SHA, corpus acceptance, uncertainty report). Never automatic promotion. |

## Authorization remaining (experimental prep before Gate 2)

| Checkpoint | Meaning | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **R2a schema** | Phase-scoped auth capability + unforgeable grant ([amendment](../inter-model/CURSOR-2026-07-19-r2a-auth-schema-amendment.md)) | Hermetic implementation in PR #52 — exact-tip Copilot audit-lane + Kiro PASS pending |
| **R2a execution** | Create isolated external dirs + shadow config files only | **Not authorized** |
| **R2b** | Immutable capture + corpus package | Not authorized |
| **B-Accept** | Human corpus acceptance | Not authorized |
| **C0** | Freeze queries, labels, thresholds, manifest hashes | Not authorized |
| **R3** | Model pull/probe | Not authorized |
| **R4 / R5** | Nomic / challenger shadow builds | Not authorized |
| **R7** | Smoke, pilot, latency, paired evaluation | Not authorized |
| **R8** | Destructive cleanup of experimental artifacts | Not authorized |

Map: Gate 1 ≈ historical R1 (done). R2a–R7 = pre–Gate 2 prep. Gate 2 = evidence review after R7. Promotion = new architecture loop.

## Gate 1 shipped capabilities

- Canonical capture CLI (**Chroma always required**): post-Chroma recheck; **canonical overlap policy** (40/30/30 — under-quota → `UNRESOLVED`); immutable `historical_spot_check.json`
- Separate adjudication CLI + `corpus_acceptance.json` (spot-check never edited); real path is run-manifest-gated
- Shadow builder: package SHA + fingerprint, write-once manifest, collection vs comparison reuse, `units_per_sec`
- **Operation-specific run-manifest binders** (capture / adjudicate / config_generation / baseline_build / challenger_build / compare / model_execution): reject missing, extra, or mismatched fields; real mode requires external `<manifest>.approved.sha256` sidecar
- Real shadow builds force corpus acceptance from auth context (CLI flag cannot disable)
- Embed adapters: `fake`, `http-fake`, gated `ollama` behind `model_execution`
- Compare modes:
  - `injectable` — hermetic scoring via `--scores-json`; latency labeled `fabricated_clock`
  - `subprocess` — real `query_units` via `CONVMEM_CONFIG` workers; one-shot for isolation; long-lived per-arm workers for warm latency (5 discarded warmups + 20 timed reps, counterbalanced); process startup reported separately
- Subprocess mode **fails closed**: worker exit codes, error results, malformed output, and startup-identity mismatches abort the compare (exit 5) — never recorded as misses or 0.0 latency
- **Per-arm identity binding**: `baseline_/challenger_model_tag` + `_config_sha256` from parsed arm configs; `--embed-host` verified against both configs and worker banners; enrichment (`decisions-approved.jsonl`) hashed and required byte-identical across arms
- Fallback exercise wired into the compare CLI (`--exercise-fallback --fallback-config`): wrong query-vector dimension from a dedicated endpoint while preserving readable `chroma.sqlite3`; `fallback_exercised=true` only on fallback-only sentinel, else the run aborts (exit 4)
- **Collection provenance gate (read-only, pre-worker)**: compare recomputes package SHA / corpus fingerprint / unit count / canonical ID-set hash from the package (duplicate IDs refused) and verifies both shadow collections' stored `convmem:*` metadata **and actual contents** (row count + exact ID set via SQLite `mode=ro`) before any endpoint contact or worker start; arms must also agree with each other; report records recomputed identity, per-arm stored metadata + actual counts + ID-set fingerprints, `approved_manifest_body_sha256`, `run_manifest_file_sha256`, and build-result hashes
- **Real-mode compare binds every evidence-affecting control**: manifest `compare_mode` must be `subprocess` (injectable is fixture-only); `--scores-json` rejected; latency required unless manifest sets `allow_skip_latency=true`; throughput read from manifest-bound `baseline_/challenger_build_result` files (CLI units-per-sec rejected; build results must have `status=OK` and their model/package SHA/fingerprint/unit count must match the verified collections); frozen `decisions-approved.jsonl` must exist in both arms; fallback allowed only when the manifest binds `paths.fallback_config` + `fallback_config_sha256` + `fallback_embed_host`
- Build binders accept per-arm `baseline_model_tag` / `challenger_model_tag` so one Gate 2 manifest can authorize distinct baseline and challenger models
- Schema fixtures: `eval_schema_*` and `eval_methodology_schema_*` (category handling only — **not** a real corpus pilot)
- Doctor embed identity via SQLite `mode=ro`

## Real pilot (post Gate 1 merge / pre Gate 2)

The actual 25–40-query pilot must use resolvable real corpus/ledger IDs, receive Claude label/coverage review, and have query/relevance hashes bound into the approved Gate 2 run-manifest. That is run preparation, not another Gate 1 authorization.

## Not authorized under Gate 1

Real corpus capture, external configs under `~/.config/convmem` or `~/.local/share/convmem/eval`, model pull/probe, real shadow builds/evaluations, service changes, promotion, cleanup.

## Uncertainty rule (manifest fields)

`primary_metric`, `primary_view=embedding_influenced`, `tie_epsilon`, `significance_alpha`, `confidence_level`, `bootstrap_seed`, `bootstrap_resamples`, `minimum_non_tied_pairs`.

Challenger **BETTER** only when mean paired delta > 0, CI excludes zero positively, sign-test p ≤ alpha, and effective non-tied n ≥ minimum; else **INCONCLUSIVE** or **WORSE**. Evidence only — not promotion authority.

## Notes

- `pending_decisions.jsonl` is not in `query_units` closure.
- Crash-safe writes via `eval_corpus.io_atomic`.
- Historical review / unadjudicated spot-check blocks Gate 2 corpus acceptance.
