# Verify Plan — Safe Harbor

> **Arc: Safe Harbor. Initial V1 RECORDED at runtime `fa82028`; correction evidence INCOMPLETE.** Ryan granted the bounded correction in execution section 8. The historical 41-test result does not satisfy its three outstanding checks. Exact-tip BugBot remains pending; V2–V6 remain NOT RUN.

Planning Status
Phase:        Execute Task — T1 correction granted; evidence incomplete
Characters:   Implementer, Test-First Reviewer
Function:     Implementer
Lanes:        Cursor collected isolated V1; Kiro signs off later; Ryan owns gates
Authority:    Bounded T1 correction granted; BugBot pending; T2–T5 not granted
```

**Subject / implementation tip:** historical runtime behavior is `fa82028b762e5564eed9f2884336ccfb0e3caf73`, with the initial evidence candidate at `b5d6edcc0040a665f40c2118b15aedefe9fb24ff`. The correction-grant commit changes only documentation. Corrected runtime/evidence are not yet available; external review must bind to the eventual successor candidate.

**PRs:** none.

**Direction:** [ARCHITECTURE-safe-harbor.md](ARCHITECTURE-safe-harbor.md), approved at `5ea16a6`.

**Plan:** [EXECUTION-safe-harbor.md](EXECUTION-safe-harbor.md).

**Goal:** demonstrate the approved guard/recovery behavior without extending coverage or claiming unperformed recovery.

## Human consequence

If implemented and accepted, guarded failures remain contained with evidence until validated owner disposition; unavailable/tombstoned approval state cannot silently become a retry. This is a planned consequence, not shipped behavior. Rollout, actual recovery qualification and closure remain separate.

Who: Codex authored this stub; Cursor supplies implementation evidence later. What/when: verification map for the first execution-plan draft. Why/how: bind each safety claim to fixture effects, fault cases and an exact reviewed revision before acceptance.

## Scope lock

In scope: execution T1–T5 and their named production entrypoints under isolated fixture configuration. Out of scope: live corpus, service activation, new backup repositories, drive writes, live restore, T4/V4k, v3 activation, global freeze or broad permission changes.

## Verification design

- **Independent oracle:** fixture logical rows/documents/vectors/tombstones and export bytes; separate event reduction; durable marker/evidence file hashes; fresh-process admission results. Source identity and file existence alone do not prove behavior.
- **Failure injection:** barriers around native admission/recheck, every preservation/replacement and release publication edge; process termination/restart; short write, ENOSPC and fsync failures. Hardware power-loss durability is not implied by process-kill trials.
- **Negative controls:** no-op preflight, overwrite-single-incident marker, copy-over-original retry, census-only release, stale-disposition replay, approval retry that assumes a failed append rolled back, and state recheck moved outside the guard. Each must fail the corresponding independent assertion.
- **Dual-path coverage:** CLI add/upsert and indexed approval, CLI/direct approval recovery, guarded native mutation, audit, recover/reconcile/clear script and watch's recovery caller. Restic tests cover all five distinct consumers. Name any inaccessible path as a gap.

## V0 — Preconditions and external review

**Plan prerequisites satisfied:** Ryan accepted the plan and explicitly approved v2 B-E4.1 at `dca13a59a2edf649ac6a19777f572645bea8674e`, including all five consumer outcomes, with ownership unchanged. This is approval metadata, not runtime evidence.

**T1 grant satisfied:** Ryan subsequently granted the proposed T1/Cursor isolated implementation and its specified V1 evidence; execution section 8 records the boundary. T2–T5 have no grant.

Isolated V1 ran. Production CLI, MCP, session indexing, Restic, providers, services and external drives were not invoked.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `gate_applicability` | `required` |
| `reason` | T1 changes quarantine persistence, admission control flow, and lock ordering |
| `subject_tip_sha` | pending corrected candidate; initial subject `b5d6edcc0040a665f40c2118b15aedefe9fb24ff`, runtime `fa82028b762e5564eed9f2884336ccfb0e3caf73` |
| `bugbot_reviewed_sha` | `n/a` |
| `result` | pending — no pull request exists, and this grant does not authorize opening one or posting a review comment |
| `finding_disposition` | `none` |
| `authority_reference` | execution section 8; Ryan granted isolated T1/V1 only |

An applicable SHA mismatch remains FAIL. This row does not make the branch merge-ready.

## V1 — Incident authority (T1)

**Historical run RECORDED by Cursor for runtime `fa82028b762e5564eed9f2884336ccfb0e3caf73`.** Isolated pytest exit 0: `41 passed in 40.45s`. Interpreter `/home/lauer/miniforge3/bin/python` 3.13.12; chromadb 1.5.9; numpy 2.4.4. Fixture roots were pytest temporary directories under `/tmp`, with `HOME`, `XDG_*`, `CONVMEM_CONFIG` and `CONVMEM_ROOT` pointed at a fresh `/tmp/safe-harbor-t1-*` directory and `CONVMEM_T1_ISOLATED=1`. The suite refuses `/home/lauer/.local/share/convmem` and `runtime-main`. Codex did not rerun these tests during the static handoff check.

**Correction acceptance remains INCOMPLETE.** Ryan authorized the following under execution section 8; none has corrected runtime evidence yet:

- Canonical client/store/cache identity, including real alias-client construction and stale-client reload/refusal regression.
- A persisted, schema-valid empty incident set must refuse admission in a fresh process without the requested mutation; genuinely missing remains the control.
- The actual A-then-B publication workflow must fail its retention assertion under an isolated overwrite-only publisher, then pass with the real implementation. The existing fabricated/truncated-marker assertions do not satisfy this control.

Record the successor subject, isolated commands/results and expected failing control before changing these obligations to PASS. The initial run remains historical and does not imply T1 acceptance.

Command:

```bash
iso=$(mktemp -d /tmp/safe-harbor-t1-XXXX)
mkdir -p "$iso/home" "$iso/config" "$iso/data" "$iso/cache"
export HOME="$iso/home" XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$iso/config" XDG_DATA_HOME="$iso/data" \
  XDG_CACHE_HOME="$iso/cache" CONVMEM_CONFIG="$iso/config/config.toml" \
  CONVMEM_ROOT="$iso/root" CONVMEM_T1_ISOLATED=1
unset DEEPSEEK_API_KEY OPENAI_API_KEY
python -m pytest tests/test_safe_harbor_t1.py tests/test_chroma_write_guard.py -q --tb=line
```

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| Incident A then B, including two findings on one segment; fresh-process admission refused | Reported PASS in initial run; actual overwrite-publication negative control INCOMPLETE |
| Missing marker versus null, scalar, empty object, unknown schema, invalid set, wrong target, unreadable file, and recognized legacy bytes preserved on adoption | PASS |
| Canonical aliases share one guard and lock; a competing legacy guard directory is reported and no empty canonical authority is created | PASS |
| Audit failure, then pass, skipped, and diagnostic error, leaves the marker in place | PASS |
| `recover()` and guarded write recheck after the lock, using a ready/release barrier rather than a timed guess | PASS |
| Audit holds the native lock across publication while a concurrent guarded write does not land | PASS |
| Short write, file fsync failure, and directory fsync failure raise containment unavailable, do not claim a durable stop, and do not apply the requested mutation | PASS |
| Ordinary clear and the guard/audit doctor checks do not rewrite a present or malformed marker | PASS |
| Existing guard regression file, including restore, quarantine, and audit behavior that T1 still allows | PASS (`tests/test_chroma_write_guard.py`, included in the 41) |

Gaps, not passes:

- Process barriers and injected fsync failures are not hardware power-loss proof.
- A directory fsync failure can leave marker bytes visible while the operation reports containment unavailable. Callers must not treat that file as a durable stop.
- Initial candidate permits a well-formed incident document with zero incidents. Ryan's correction requires persisted-empty refusal; the permissive test is not accepted evidence.
- Initial candidate leaves Chroma's client cache keyed by the original path string while guard/load records are canonical. Ryan has now authorized `chroma_store.py` solely to close this identity gap and collect its isolated regression evidence.
- Successful segment restore can still continue the caller's write. Making every restore stick as an incident is T3, and it was not implemented.
- The full default pytest suite and production doctor were not run. They are not isolated from service and corpus entrypoints.

## V2 — Target binding and freshness (T2)

**NOT RUN.** Target/profile/affected-path equality and coverage; prod/lab bypass behavior; changed config; all five consumer outcomes; old versus future snapshots; no future-triggered backup/fallback; unchanged exemptions. Require effect assertions through actual callers and existing numeric error mapping.

## V3 — Preservation and bounded restore (T3)

**NOT RUN.** Original bytes write-once; preservation complete before replacement; pinned source generations; all interruption/IO failure windows; restore aborts initiating mutation even after clean census; only incident-bound existing repair may cross quarantine; persistent census failure remains contained.

## V4 — Release and stale-vector proof (T3)

**NOT RUN.** Complete current incident set and Ryan disposition binding; added-finding invalidation; durable disposition before marker removal; truncated event tail and uncertain unlink/fsync behavior; strict source-watermark oracle. Before the remainder of T3 implementation, record the pinned-backend monotonicity/queue-purge/restart demonstration, including a valid releasable control and a same-ID changed-vector fixture demonstrating the census blind spot and refusal. Failure stops T3; it is not census-only PASS. Release-publication assertions must include file fsync, parent-directory fsync on creation and required newly created directory entries; inject directory-fsync failure and require containment to remain before marker removal. Process restart is not power-loss proof.

## V5 — Approval recovery (T4)

**NOT RUN.** Cold/warm caches; unknown/absent/tombstoned/conflicting/matching states; direct and CLI callers; actual lease/governed/native/export order; forced forget/refine competition; target substitution; partial Chroma/export/event completion and retry. Cover failure before completion append, partial record, complete record with failed fsync, and durable record followed by interrupted return. An unsuccessful invocation may leave APPROVED; assert truthful uncertain-outcome reporting, authoritative reread/reduction before retry, durability establishment before success, no duplicate approval/blind re-upsert, no hidden export loss and no automatic malformed-tail deletion. Readable bytes alone do not prove durability. All cases remain unrun.

Explicitly cover new-log creation versus append to an existing durable log: file fsync in both, parent-directory fsync for creation, and durable publication of any newly created directory entries. Inject each required directory-fsync failure; require uncertain-outcome reporting and authoritative retry without duplicate approval, not a false APPROVAL_STARTED assertion. These are scheduled assertions, not executed evidence.

## V6 — Integrated handoff and independent sign-off (T5)

**NOT RUN.** All required cases and negative controls accounted for at the implementation tip; policy docs synchronized; no production/drive/provider access; truthful scope/operational prerequisites; written independent verdict with residuals and Ryan gate. Reviewers perform no cleanup or corrective live operations.

## Evidence log

| When | Runner | Subject | Command / case | Result | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-11 | Cursor, isolated miniforge Python 3.13.12 | runtime `fa82028b762e5564eed9f2884336ccfb0e3caf73` | `pytest tests/test_safe_harbor_t1.py tests/test_chroma_write_guard.py -q --tb=line` under temporary HOME/XDG/CONVMEM_CONFIG | PASS, exit 0, `41 passed in 40.45s` | V1 table above |
| 2026-10-11 | Cursor | same runtime parent; review tip is the evidence commit | BugBot exact-tip review | pending | V0 gate row; no PR authority |

SKIP does not satisfy a required safety claim. No session-start health result fills a runtime or recovery row. V2–V6 stay NOT RUN.

## Merge reading

- [Execution plan](EXECUTION-safe-harbor.md)
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE-safe-harbor.md)
- [Current STATUS](STATUS-safe-harbor.md)
- [Active routing](../inter-model/LATEST.md)

## TL;DR

[Arc Safe Harbor] The initial 41-test run remains historical evidence. Ryan granted three T1 corrections; their runtime evidence is incomplete and exact-tip BugBot remains pending. V2–V6, deployment and arc closure stay ungranted.
